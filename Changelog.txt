Updated tutorial and licensing information (removed commercial license, all Free and Open Source Software). 
Cleaned up the builds and moved to GIT repository for primary source code control.

3.0.0 - 7/29/2015
Lots of changes to support inheritance patterns in the ROMNode and LinearEngine libraries.
All string handling in std::string, UTF8.
Upgraded EDSEngine C++ library with a multi-threaded table solver (C++)
WinRT libraries removed. You can call the native C++ libs from RT, so there is really no benefit to that interface, especially since a C# and Javascript port are already available.
A CMake build script is now available for both Linux and Windows.

2.1.1 - 12/16/2014 
Bug #19 - Fixed concurrency issue when multiple threads evaluate the same table.  Also fixed a typo in a previous fix to the ROM GetRoot function.

2.1 - 12/15/2014
Accumulation of minor bugfixes and addition of some minor features such as prototype based inheritence pattern in JavaScript implementation.  Added "Value" to represent current attribute value in the ROM DictionaryAttr class for use in databinding situations.

2.0 - 3/26/2014
Library is now threadsafe and makes use of C++11 concepts.  Some API changes, see user documentation.  Suuport for Silverlight and Flash wrappers dropped.

1.3.4 - 12/30/2013
Bug #18 - Fixed Clone function in ROM C++ and JavaScript.
Updated JavaScript components for IE11.
Enforced non-copyable pattern on C++ ROM.  ROM is designed to be a polymorphic base object.

1.3.3 - 9/11/2013
Bug #16 - Fixed a possible error in DecisionLogic editor Find/Replace dialog.  Also eliminated carriage returns from pasted text.

1.3.2 - 7/30/2013
Fixed an issue in the C++ implementation of RelationalObjectModel where reserved XML characters were not properly escaped.

Major performance boost for EDSEngine C++ library.  4-fold increase in some benchmarks.

1.3 - 5/7/2013
Fixed copy-paste issue in DecisionLogic under Linux: #14
Fixed file handling issues when renaming files, or re-adding previously removed files to a DecisionLogic project
Made attribute handling functions of Relational Object Modeler virtual

1.2.2 - 4/10/2013
Fixed a freeze when saving a table in DecisionLogic with a malformed "get()" expression, where the closing parenthesis is missing: #3610507

1.2.1 - 4/8/2013
Fixed possible memory leak when debugging EDSEngine table evaluations.
Upgraded boost libraries to v1.53.
Added Code::Blocks project files

Fixed a crash in DecisionLogic when inserting a table into a new group: #3598709

v1.1.6 - 11/13/2012

Fixed leak/crash issue in DestroyObject (C++): #3571423

v1.1.3 - 8/30/2012
Fixed issue with ROM SaveXML output when attribute values contain reservered XML characters/escapes. #3563153

v1.1.2 - 8/15/2012
Fixed problem with reserved character #, it should only be reserved for edit attribute types: #3558119

v1.1.1 - 7/10/2012
Fixed DecisionLogic not allowing disable of first table rule in compiled output: #3542354 
Fixed ROM SaveXML not outputting correctly after a call to RemoveAttribute: #3542353

v1.1.0 - 7/9/2012

Updated Linux builds for compatibility with Ubuntu 12.
Removed dependencies on zlib and win32 calls for UUID generation.  These features are now handled by the boost C++ libraries for all platforms.  This fixes issues with mixed mode debugging under VS2008.
New tables in DecisionLogic will default to "GetAll" style.
Fixed the wording of the Remove/Delete DecisionLogic table prompts.
Fixed some build paths and library names to remove whitespace for Linux build compatibility.

v1.0.6 - 6/27/2012
Fixed issue with boolean enabled/disabled property not set correctly after reset: #3538455
Fixed file overwrite problem in DecisionLogic when inserting an existing table file: #3538557 
Table with no inputs always behaves as GetAll regardless of selected behaviour: #3538577
Altered the VS2008 project include paths to be more compatible with Windows SDK command line build system

v1.0.5 - 6/9/2012
Fixed issue with subsequent dependencies setting the ChangedByUser flag incorrectly due to recursion issue
Fixed help HTML file link in DecisionLogic

v1.0.4 - 6/7/2012
Allow BOOLEAN types to set a default value directly in the LinearEngine dictionary
Prevent DecisionLogic from overwriting table files when compiling to XML
Cache last filename of compiled output in DecisionLogic

v1.0.3 - 6/5/2012
Allow BOOLEAN types to omit rule table output in the LinearEngine dictionary
Fixed BOOLEAN type initialization bug
Prevent errors when calling into the libraries for invalid table names

v1.0.2 - 5/24/2012
Added Visual Studio 2012 project files and build script
Fixed reset issue in JavaScript evaluation of SINGLESELECT attribute types in the LinearEngine functions
Fixed copy-paste bug in DecisionLogic when copying many cells between multiple tables/MS Excel
Sorted attribute display alphabetically in the debugging controls
Made some changes to support wxWidgets 2.9.x beta when compiling DeicsionLogic in VS2010.  This is for future use, standard is still VS2008+wxWidgets 2.8.x  
Added new resetting/invalidation behaviours to the LinearEngine component

v1.0.1 - 6/1/2011
Fixed an issue with the way strings were de-tokenized in JavaScript in order to improve performance of the rule table evaluation
